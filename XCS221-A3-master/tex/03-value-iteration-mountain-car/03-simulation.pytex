\item \points{3c}

Run |value-iteration| to train the agent using model based value iteration you implemented above and see the plot of reward per episode.
Comment on the plot, and discuss when might model based value iteration perform poorly. You can also run |python mountaincar.py --agent value-iteration| to visually observe how the trained agent performs the task now.

\textbf{What we expect: } 2-3 sentences describing the plot and discussion of when model based value iteration may fail.
