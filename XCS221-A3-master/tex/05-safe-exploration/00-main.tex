\item {\bf Safe Exploration}

We learned about different state exploration policies for RL in order to get information about \texttt{(s,a)}. 
The method implemented in our MDP code is epsilon-greedy exploration, which balances both exploitation (choosing the action a that 
maximizes $\hat{Q}_{\text{opt}}(s, a))$ and exploration (choosing the action a randomly).
$$\pi_{\text{act}}(s) = \begin{cases} \arg\max_{a \in \text{Actions}}\hat{Q}_{\text{opt}}(s,a) & \text{probability } 1 - \epsilon \\ 
\text{random from Actions}(s) & \text{probability } \epsilon \end{cases}$$

In real-life scenarios when safety is a concern, there might be constraints that need to be set in the state exploration phase. 
For example, robotic systems that interact with humans should not cause harm to humans during state exploration. 
\cite{fn-2} in RL is thus a critical research question in the field of AI safety 
and human-AI interaction. 

Assume there are harmful consequences for the driver of a mountain-car if the car exceeds a certain velocity. 
One very simple approach of constrained RL is to restrict the set of potential actions that the agent can take at each step. 
We want to apply this approach to restrict the states that the agent can explore in order to prevent reaching unsafe speeds.
