\item \points{5a}

The implementation of the Mountain Car MDP you built in the previous questions actually already has velocity constraints in the form of a \texttt{self.max\_speed} parameter.
Read through OpenAI Gym's \href{https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/mountain_car.py#L106}{Mountain Car implementation} and explain how \texttt{self.max\_speed} is used. 

\textbf{What we expect:} One sentence on how \texttt{self.max\_speed} parameter is used in \texttt{custom\_mountain\_car.py}
