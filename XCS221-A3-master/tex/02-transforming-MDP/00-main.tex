\item {\bf Transforming MDPs}

In computer science, the idea of a reduction is very powerful:
say you can solve problems of type A,
and you want to solve problems of type B.
If you can convert (reduce) any problem of type B to type A,
then you automatically have a way of solving problems of type B
potentially without doing much work!
We saw an example of this for search problems when we reduce A* to UCS.
Now let's do it for solving MDPs.
