\item \points{4c}
For general $K$, what is the treewidth corresponding to the posterior
distribution over all $K$ car locations at all $T$ time steps conditioned on all
the sensor readings:
\[\mathbb P(C_{11} = c_{11}, \dots, C_{1K} = c_{1K}, \dots, C_{T1} = c_{T1}, \dots, C_{TK} = c_{TK} \mid E_1 = e_1, \dots, E_T = e_T)?\]
Briefly justify your answer.

For reference, the treewidth of a factor graph is defined as the maximum arity (number of variables that a factor depends on) of any factor created 
by variable elimination under the best variable elimination ordering. 
You can find further information, along with an example, that may be relevant to this problem 
\href{https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-221/cheatsheet-variables-models}{here}.

\textbf{Note}: the conditioning is already done, so the only factors remaining are for $C_{ti}$ variables.
